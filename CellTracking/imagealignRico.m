%ImageAlign.m
%Registers image stacks using a common reference stack.  
%Calls on dftregistration.m
%
%INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
%Save each image stack you want to register in separate directories.  Also
%save the reference image stack (which contains features from which it is 
%possible to track drift) in its own directory.  The program will create
%new directories for each of the image stacks to be registered in the same
%parent directory.  The reference stacks and the stacks to be registered
%should have the same number of images.
%
%INPUT
%basename: choose a name for the directories in which the aligned images
%          will be saved.
%dirname:  cell array containing the paths of the directories in which the
%          image stacks to be registered are.
%regname:  path of reference directory.
%
%CALLS ON:
%dftregistration.m
%imtranslate.m
